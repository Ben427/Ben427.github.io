<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb lean ground beef</li>
  <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon sesame oil</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>1/2 â€“ 1 teaspoon crushed red peppers (depending on how spicy you like it)</li>
  <li>salt and pepper</li>
  <li>1 bunch green onions, diced</li>
  <li>Rice, cooked</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
<p>
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and brown hamburger with garlic in the sesame oil. Drain most of the fat and add brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, salt and pepper and red peppers. Simmer for a few minutes to blend the flavors. Serve over steamed rice and top with green onions.
</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Usually we'll use "meat crumbles" which is a sort of fake meat but you can hardly tell the difference. Usually it doesn't come in 1 lb packages so we adjust accordingly.</p>
