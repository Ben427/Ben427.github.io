<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 block firm or extra-firm tofu, well pressed</li>
  <li>1/3 cup soy milk or another non-dairy milk substitute</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons mustard</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley or Italian seasoning blend (optional)</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt or seasoned salt</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Press the tofu.</li>
  <li>Slice the tofu into 1 inch cubes, or some fun shape.</li>
  <li>Mix up the milk and spices.</li>
  <li>Dip each piece of tofu into the liquid mix and then coat in breadcrumbs.</li>
  <li>Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or so</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Very good overall. First attempt was a bit underseasoned because I was missing mustard and onion powder. It's also fun to place with different sauces to dip the tofu in.</p>
